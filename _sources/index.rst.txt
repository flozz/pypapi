Welcome to PyPAPI's documentation!
==================================

PyPAPI is a Python binding for the PAPI (Performance Application Programming
Interface) library. PyPAPI only implements the PAPI High Level API but feel
free to let us know if you require access to the low-level API.

Example usage:
--------------

::

    from pypapi import papi_high
    from pypapi import events as papi_events

    # Starts some counters
    papi_high.start([
        papi_events.PAPI_FP_OPS,
        papi_events.PAPI_TOT_CYC
    ])

    # Reads values from counters and reset them
    results = papi_high.read_counters()  # -> [int, int]

    # Reads values from counters and stop them
    results = papi_high.stop()  # -> [int, int]
